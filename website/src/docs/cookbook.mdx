# Cookbook


## Adding a formatter to a project

## Combining executables


## Writing your own language support functions

### Initializers

Let's say you have an existing `npm` project, and you want to start using `garn`
with it. You could write the `garn.ts` from scratch. But ideally `garn` would
help you out, *noticing* that you have a node project, and generating the
corresponding `garn` file for it.

That's where initializers come in. Initilizers correspond to a function
(`mkNpmProject` in the example above), and:

1. Decide whether to run at all in the existing codebase (in the `node` example,
   we could base the decision on whether have a `package.json` file) package;
2. Add imports to the resulting `garn.ts` file (the imports you might need);
3. Add exports (`Project`s, usually) to the resulting `garn.ts` function.
